Words cannot explain how difficult it is to look in the mirror after being stagnant for years. Your passion and zest for life are like a candle that's been blown out. You wake up every morning and wait until the moment you can crawl back into bed. You see your friends and the first words out of their mouth are "Where the hell have you been?". You walk up to the woman you love and the first thought in her mind is "I hope he's okay today".

Clinical depression has robbed me (and many others) of the most important aspects of my life. I am trying to work towards getting better.

I've made so many plans, started so many projects, and made so many promises to myself. All of which were started and left unfinished. I would like to complete at least _one_ goal (hopefully more) from start to finish this year.

One project I'd like to take off the backburner is writing and publishing a book. I used to have a passion for computer science that kept me going each day. As a die hard Linux fan I would love to begin by writing an introduction to the Linux command line. It would be a free resource for teachers, students, and anyone who is interested.

Each chapter will be posted here as I write them and when it is complete, I will move on to figuring out how to publish it.

This is a promise to you, and a promise to me
