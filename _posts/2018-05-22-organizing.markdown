The end goal here is to use Linux and the command line interface to simplify your life. 

You will need the following:

* A simple task manager that works with google cal (most likely task warrior).

* A script where you can enter work shifts for the week.

* A simple text editor for writing.

* Something less complicated than VIM for coding.

* A good text-based web browser.

* A music player for spotify.

* Accounting software

* E-mail
