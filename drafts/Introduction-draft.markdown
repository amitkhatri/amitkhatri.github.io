If you are reading this book you are probably used to your desktop looking like
this:

Before we had access to these beautiful(colorful?) and easy to use interfaces a
"desktop" looked a lot like this:

The above image is the "command line interface" (often abbreviated CLI). Instead
of using your mouse to visually select folders and open applications, you would
instruct the computer by typing in a series of commands.

Though it may seem archaic the command line is a powerful tool which
is used on a daily basis by software developers, system administrators, and
computer enthusiasts. Don't be fooled by its minimalistic look, you can use the
command line to do anything from moving files around to playing your entire
music library!
